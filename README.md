# NASA polynomials
NASA polynomials are a very convenient way of representing the thermodynamic
properties of molecules. They are widely used in plasma modelling. However,
since a single, widely-used compilation (from NASA, hence the name) covering about 60 molecules
made several decades ago there appears to have been appears to have been no new work
on this problem meaning there are no polynomials available for many species.

Recently there have been a number of extensive compilations of partition functions
covering extended temperature ranges, including ones by the UCL ExoMol group.
This project will involve taking a set of partition functions from a given source
and writing a program to generate NASA polynomials from them. The results can be tested
against the original NASA compilation for key species. The aim of the project would be
to publish an expanded set of NASA polynomials for general use.
